KEY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

⚠ ACCELERATED MELTING MODEL APPLIED
  Based on current climate change projections
  Melting rate: 0.8-1.5% per year (accelerating)

Projected cumulative glacier loss by 2050: 23.4%

⚠⚠ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠⚠
Model predicts severe glacier retreat under current climate trends.
This represents a significant loss of freshwater resources.

MILESTONE PREDICTIONS:
  10% glacier loss: ~2037
